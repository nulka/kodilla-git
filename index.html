            Ground control to major Tom <br>
            Ground control to major Tom <br>
            Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. <br>
            Ground control to major Tom <br>
            Commencing countdown, engines on <br>
            Check ignition and may Gods love be with you... <br>
            (Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, <br>
            Four, three, two, one, liftoff...)
        </p>

        <p>
            This is ground control to major Tom<br>
            You've really made the grade!<br>
            And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear.<br>
            Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is major Tom to ground control;<br>
            I'm stepping through the door<br>
            And I'm floating in a most peculiar way<br>
            And the stars look very different today.<br>
            For here<br>
            Am I sitting in my tin can,<br>
            Far above the World<br>
            Planet Earth is blue,<br>
            And there's nothing I can do<br>
            Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles<br>
            I'm feeling very still,<br>
            And I think my spaceship knows which way to go<br>
            Tell my wife I love her very much<br>
            She knows<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Ground control to major Tom<br>
            Your circuits dead, there's something wrong<br>
            Can you hear me, major Tom?<br>
            Can you hear me, major Tom?<br>
            Can you hear me, major Tom?<br>
            Can you....
        </p>

        <p>
            Here am I floating 'round my tin can<br>
            Far above the moon<br>
            Planet Earth is blue<br>
            And theres nothing I can do...
        </p>
