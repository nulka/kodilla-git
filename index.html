    <h1>"Space Oddity"</h1>
    <h2>by David Bowie</h2>

    <p>Ground control to major Tom /
        Ground control to major Tom /
        Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. /

        Ground control to major Tom /
        Commencing countdown, engines on /
        Check ignition and may Gods love be with you... /

        (Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, /
        Four, three, two, one, liftoff...)</p>

    <p>This is ground control to major Tom
        You've really made the grade!
        And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear.
        Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

        This is major Tom to ground control;
        I'm stepping through the door
        And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
        And the stars look very different today.

        For here
        Am I sitting in my tin can,
        Far above the World
        Planet Earth is blue,
        And there's nothing I can do

        Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
        I'm feeling very still,
        And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
        Tell my wife I love her very much
        She knows
    </p>

    <p>Ground control to major Tom
        Your circuits dead, there's something wrong
        Can you hear me, major Tom?
        Can you hear me, major Tom?
        Can you hear me, major Tom?
        Can you....


        Here am I floating 'round my tin can
        Far above the moon
        Planet Earth is blue
        And theres nothing I can do...</p>
